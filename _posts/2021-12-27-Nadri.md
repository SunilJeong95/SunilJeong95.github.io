## About
This domestic travel planner site is called by "Nadri". 
"Nadri" is the pronounced sound of the word meaning travel in Korea.
I was the leader in this project and proceeded with 5 members. 
The reason for planning "Nadri" was that the demand for domestic travel was expected to increase 
further at a time when it was difficult to travel abroad due to COVID-19, 
and there were relatively few domestic travel planner sites.
"Nadri" is my first project using Spring Framework. 
So it was challenging for me. Nevertheless, I was able to finish well with good team members. 
Thank you to Dahye, Seonghyeon, Taekyung, Seoyoung, and Sunah.
