## About
This Project is based on a project I worked on before (iOS Application for GroupBuying [2020.07. ~ 2020.08]) 
GroupBuying project was a location-based project and a social media app that connected user[(GroupBuying)](https://projectintheclass.github.io/GroupBuying/).

Private Lessoning Project is 1-on-1 teacher-student matching app and a one-man project.
This project is similar to GroupBuying, but chatting part I added is different.
In GruopBuying project, We used KaKao Open Chatting beacause we don't have enough time to implement chatting.
In Private Lessoning Project, I added real-time chatting. Also, I added location range settings.
